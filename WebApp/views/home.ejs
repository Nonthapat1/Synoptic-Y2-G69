        <h1>Goven</h1>
        <p>Govan is an urban community located on the 
            south-side of the River Clyde. It is an area with a 
            rich history and heritage that has been shaped 
            by its physical waterfront location. It is one of the 
            most historically significant areas in Glasgow 
            that has been transformed across the years.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is your opportunity to explore the historic 
            significance of Govan and the experiences of refugees 
            and people seeking asylum arriving and living in the 
            community.
            <br>
            <br>
            For over 100 years, Govan was the undisputed 
            industrial powerhouse of the worldâ€™s shipbuilding 
            industry. The name Govan became synonymous with 
            shipbuilding. With shipbuilding came urbanisation 
            and the population rose from 9,000 in the 1860s to 
            approximately 150,000 in the 1950s.
            <br>
            <br>
            Following World War II and increased shipbuilding 
            competition from abroad, the industry dramatically 
            declined and the population decreased. Govan as a 
            result suffered social and economic deprivation, due to 
            its heavy reliance on shipbuilding, leaving abandoned 
            buildings and derelict land throughout. The River Clyde 
            that once drove rapid industrialisation is now a physical 
            barrier between Govan and Glasgow City Centre.
            <br>
            <br>
            Despite Govan experiencing economic and 
            physical decline over decades, opportunities in and 
            around Govan open up community aspirations for 
            environmental resilience, and economic and societal regeneration. 
            The community is actively working to 
            create a vibrant and prosperous future.
